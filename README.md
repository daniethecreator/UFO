## Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback is the page is now a bit messy with multiple filter buckets next to a large data set with columns.  Althought this allows for more filtering and customization, visually it can be a bit overwhelming. 

One recommendation is to make the process of attaching an event to listen for changes to each filter into a for loop, taking five lines of code and condenseing it to three for a faster process and more efficient code. 

Another recommendation is to add a duration filter or even include some summaries of the data such as average duration, state with most sitings, and most common shape.
